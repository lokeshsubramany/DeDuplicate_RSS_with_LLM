These rules are necessary to prevent the models from saying or generating inappropriate or false content. The company's ""model spec"" outlines high-level objectives, hard rules, and general behavior guidelines that indirectly govern the models. This provides insight into how a company sets its priorities and handles edge cases. For example, the developer's intent is considered the highest law, and the model will refuse to generate certain content if it goes against this intent. Additionally, the model may decline to talk about certain topics or provide personal information in order to prevent manipulation attempts. OpenAI's model spec also addresses privacy concerns, such as when it is appropriate to provide someone's contact information. However, defining and enforcing these rules is a complex task, and policies may fail as people find ways to circumvent them. While OpenAI is not revealing all of its instructions, the model spec offers a helpful look into how these rules and guidelines are set and why."

This new version, AlphaFold 3, is more accurate and can also predict interactions with other biomolecules. The company has also made a limited version of the model available for free use online.

Since its debut in 2018, AlphaFold has been the leading method for predicting protein structure from amino acid sequences. This is crucial for understanding the function of proteins in our bodies. The new version, AlphaFold 3, is not only more accurate but also more versatile, able to model interactions with other biomolecules such as DNA and RNA.

One of the limitations of protein modeling is that even if the shape of a protein is known, it may not be clear how it interacts with other molecules. This new version of AlphaFold allows for multiple molecules to be simulated at once, providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein behavior.

To make the model more accessible, Google DeepMind has also released a free, hosted web application called AlphaFold Server. This allows non-commercial users to easily input protein sequences and receive 3D models with confidence levels for each position.

Recently, the European Commission ruled against Apple in an antitrust action, agreeing with Spotify's claims that the App Store's fees stifle innovation and harm consumer choice. In response, Apple introduced a new entitlement program that would allow music streaming apps to include external links to purchases, but with a 27% cut. Spotify has submitted multiple app updates to comply with the ruling, but Apple has rejected them, leading the dispute to go back to the European Commission. Additionally, Apple is under investigation for potential non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act, which could result in further enforcement actions. Spotify remains confident that the EU will address the issue and ensure a better experience for users."

In the meantime, Tinder is working on improving its product experience and safety features.

This shortcut, created by the Google App iOS team, allows users to start a visual search via Google Lens. It can be configured to launch other tasks as well, such as starting a ChatGPT voice session. This highlights the difficulties of innovating new ways to interact with technology on iOS, as a workaround had to be used instead of a gesture. To use the shortcut, users need to have the Google app for iOS installed and then download the shortcut and assign it to the Action Button in iOS's Settings. This feature was first spotted by 9to5Mac."

These rules are necessary to prevent the models from saying or generating inappropriate or false content. The company's ""model spec"" outlines high-level objectives, hard rules, and general behavior guidelines that indirectly govern the models. This provides insight into how a company sets its priorities and handles edge cases. For example, the developer's intent is considered the highest law, and the model will refuse to generate certain content if it goes against this intent. Additionally, the model may decline to talk about certain topics or provide personal information in order to prevent manipulation attempts. OpenAI's model spec also addresses privacy concerns, such as when it is appropriate to provide someone's contact information. However, defining and enforcing these rules is a complex task, and policies may fail as people find ways to circumvent them. While OpenAI is not revealing all of its instructions, the model spec offers a helpful look into how these rules and guidelines are set and why."

However, experts are concerned that this tool may not be enough to combat the potential chaos of AI-generated content during major global elections in 2024. OpenAI has also joined the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and will integrate tamper-resistant metadata into its tools to help verify the authenticity of AI-generated content. However, this solution is not foolproof as the metadata can still be removed. OpenAI hopes that by increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of AI detection, the adoption of this standard will increase and help combat the spread of deepfakes."

This new version, AlphaFold 3, is more accurate and can also predict interactions with other biomolecules. The company has also made a limited version of the model available for free use online.

Since its debut in 2018, AlphaFold has been the leading method for predicting protein structure from amino acid sequences. This is crucial for understanding the function of proteins in our bodies. The new version, AlphaFold 3, is not only more accurate but also more versatile, able to model interactions with other biomolecules such as DNA and RNA.

One of the limitations of protein modeling is that even if the shape of a protein is known, it may not be clear how it interacts with other molecules. This new version of AlphaFold allows for multiple molecules to be simulated at once, providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein behavior.

To make the model more accessible, Google DeepMind has also released a free, hosted web application called AlphaFold Server. This allows non-commercial users to easily input protein sequences and receive 3D models with confidence levels for each position.
